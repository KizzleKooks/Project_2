# Project_2
This project will look at the safety and wellbeing assessments undertaken where concerns for children were investigated by the department for the financial year 2015-16 and 2016-17 and compare this with the number of children that are in the care of the CEO.
Bonus time permitting: look at data related to socio economic information and population data for more indepth analysis.
